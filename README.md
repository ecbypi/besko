# package_mailer

This application serves to ease the pains of besk workers and Bexley residents
when it comes to managing packages.

The old way of doing things: 

* Look up recipients one at a time on the horrible directory search on web.mit.edu
* Add emails one by one
* Look over to see if any duplicates existed
* Send your email, leaving your sent message as a log that the package was received


The new way of doing things:

* Type in the name on the package
* Click on you typed in when it appears
* Add some package details (how many, who delivered it)
* Send notifications, recipients are automatically notified
* Packages are logged for everyone's record
